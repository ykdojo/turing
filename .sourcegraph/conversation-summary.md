# Conversation Summary

## 2025-04-16

### Session 1

1. **Initial inquiry**: User asked for an explanation of what chat-controller.ts does.
   - I explained that it's a core component that manages chat state with React hooks, handles user input and AI responses, integrates with Gemini API, and controls terminal command execution.

2. **Component relationships**: User asked about relationships between files.
   - I explained how chat-controller.ts relates to chat-ui.tsx, gemini-api.ts, tools.ts, and message-formatter.ts.
   - Outlined the data flow: UI → Controller → Gemini API → (optional: tools) → Controller → UI.

3. **Memory update**: User requested adding a process to memory for tracking conversation summaries.
   - Added to memory.md: "At every turn of conversation, create/update a summary file to keep track of the conversation history".
   - Created this conversation summary file to implement the process.
