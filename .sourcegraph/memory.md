# Memory

## Important Processes
- Always update CHANGELOG.md when making significant changes to the codebase
- Always push to origin after committing changes
- **CRITICAL: NEVER FORGET** to update the conversation summary file at `.sourcegraph/conversation-summary.md` after EVERY user interaction to keep track of the conversation history for future reference or sharing with other assistants
  - Active reminder process: At the START of each interaction, check memory file and read conversation summary for context of past interactions
  - At the END of each interaction, update conversation summary BEFORE completing my response
  - Never finish a response without updating the summary first
